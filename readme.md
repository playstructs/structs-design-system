# Structs UI (SUI)
**Structs UI** is a collection of components that can help you build interfaces within the [Structs](https://playstructs.com) universe. 

## Structs
In the distant future the species of the galaxy are embroiled in a race for Alpha Matter, the rare and dangerous substance that fuels galactic civilization. Players take command of Structs, a race of sentient machines, and must forge alliances, conquer enemies and expand their influence to control Alpha Matter and the fate of the galaxy.

[Structs](https://playstructs.com) is a decentralized game in the Cosmos ecosystem, operated and governed by our community of players--ensuring Structs remains online as long as there are players to play it.
